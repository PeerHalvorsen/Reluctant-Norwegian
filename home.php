Welcome to the Reluctant Norwegian's Meadery. One of the few places in the U.S.A. that brews and sells craft meads. </p>
<h3>What is Mead?</h3>
<p>Mead is an alcoholic beverage brewed from honey. 
It is often flavored with fruits, herbs, spices, and even grains!  Please see the
terminology page and our mead list for information on the types of mead we brew.
</p>
<h3>The Longhouse</h3>
<p>
Our longhouse offers a one of a kind place to enjoy mead just as the Vikings did on celebratory occasions. We also partner with local breweries to serve craft beer 
only available at our mead hall.
